## League Schedule

League to be scheduled every third Saturday of the month unless there is conflict with other shoots. See published calendar for more details.

Shoot schedule will be dependent on the number of shooters for any given Saturday

Schedule below is temporary â€” will likely need to revisit and adjust as the league matures

If more shooters sign up, might consider a A + B final so everyone can practice ISSF final

## Shooter position and squadding

Shooter position and squadding will be determined at the morning of the event. Participants will draw cards with varying numbers (1-6) and varying suits (diamond, aces, clover, heart). Position within the squad will be determined by the number and the squadding will be determined by the suit.

For each of the qualifying rounds, shooter position will rotate. See below for example:

| Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| 1       | 6       | 3       |
| 2       | 5       | 4       |
| 3       | 2       | 5       |
| 4       | 1       | 6       |
| 5       | 4       | 1       |
| 6       | 3       | 2       |

Shooting order in the final will be determined by the total qualifying score. Position 1 will be the highest qualifier.
