## What is BASiC?

Bay Area Skeet international Club (BASiC) is an informal club to organize friendly competition / training in the sport of International or Olympic skeet.

The group meets every 3rd Saturday of the month (see calendar for upcoming dates) to shoot 3 rounds of international skeet at Field Sports Park (San Jose, CA) + ISSF Finals.

The club tries to adhere to ISSF rules but some rules are only loosely enforced.
